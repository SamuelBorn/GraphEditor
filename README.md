# GraphEditor

This tool is an add-on for my Stipdendium from the Nassau Central Studies Fund. I develop it in the course of the TGI lecture. The program will be programmed in Java and should be able to minimize a graph and convert NEAs into DEAs.

There are only a few buttons. in the left menu you choose how you want to change the given automaton: do you want to add edges? delete nodes? etc....

In the right menu you can choose to minimize the given DEA ...Or rather load a test-DEA to save the work of entering it.
